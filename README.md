==========

TodoMVC evolved - Testing MVC frameworks on an oversimplified issue tracking system.

## Intro

[TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) is awesome in helping you to select a suitable MVC framework, but it is limited in that it only shows a very small, specific use case. Real-world software usually goes far beyond that in that it includes much more use cases that would be relevant/interesting to know how to implement them with the MVC framework you're going to choose.

I'm just doing such a review of the most popular JavaScript frameworks right now and so I thought I open source it and see what happens.

## Goals

"Issues-MVC" aims at implementing a simple issue tracking system (like GitHub's, but just simpler). Here's a very early feature spec that should be present.

- Adding a new issues
- Filtering of issues by
  - open/closed state
  - all
  - assigned to me
  - created by me
- Assignment of labels to issues
- Management of available labels
